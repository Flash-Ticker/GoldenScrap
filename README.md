**Description**
Tired of the usual currencies or always having the same thing on the server? 
The Golden Scrap plugin is the ideal admin tool to distribute scrap to players when something goes missing. It is available on Steam and can be used by any Rust server.

The Golden Scrap works like a skin that can be assigned to the scrap resource. With the SkinID: 3239303050 it is easy to give the scrap a customized look and access my Steam upload.

Integration: simply add the Golden Scrap plugin to your events or edit your loottable to best integrate the plugin into your server flow.

Required authorization: To access this tool, you need the authorization goldenscrap.admin.
