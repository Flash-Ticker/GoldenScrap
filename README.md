# GoldenScrap
The Golden Scrap Plugin is the ideal admin tool to distribute scrap to players when something goes missing. This plugin is now available on Steam and can be used by any Rust server.

How it works: The Golden Scrap works like a skin that can be assigned to the scrap resource. With the SkinID: 3239303050 it is easy to give the scrap a customized look and access my Steam upload.

Integration: Easily add the Golden Scrap plugin to your events or edit your loottable to optimally integrate the plugin into your server flow.

Required authorization: To access this tool you need the authorization goldenscrap.admin.

ChatCommand to use:
 ```inventory.give.goldenscrap “PlayerName/SteamID” GoldenScrap “Quantity”```

ConsoleCommand to use:
 ```inventory.give.goldenscrap “PlayerName/SteamID” “Quantity”```

With this command you can distribute targeted scrap to players - simply and effectively!

Use the Golden Scrap plugin to distinguish yourself from other servers and give the player a new extension.
