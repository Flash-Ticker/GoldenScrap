**Description**
Are you tired of the usual currencies or always having the same thing on the server? 
The Golden Scrap plugin is the ideal admin tool for distributing scrap to players when something is lost. It is available on Steam and can be used by any Rust server.

Golden Scrap works like a skin that can be assigned to the scrap resource. With the SkinID: 3239303050, it's easy to give the scrap a custom look and access my Steam upload.

Integration: Simply add Golden Scrap to your events or edit your loot table to integrate the plugin seamlessly into your server workflow.

**Permission**
```goldenscrap.admin```

**ChatCommand**
 ```/goldenscrap <player/steamid> <amount>```
